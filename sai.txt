firstly,
1. I launched four ubuntu instances in my free-tier aws account.
    - In that 4 ubuntu instances:
       a) we have give tag for instance 1st ubuntu instance as "Controller".
       b) On the remaining three instance tagged as Server1, Server2, Server3.
       c)Do the passwordless ssh on three instances.(server1,server2,server3).
          - using this commands:
            we have run this commands on all three server-instances.
             - first, we have to connect our servers using git-bash.
                 - sudo passwd ubuntu (for intializing password).
             - than we have to change the Password authentication:"No" to "Yes".
                 - sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
                 - goto insertion mode by pressing i.
                 - than search for password authentication and make it no to yes.
                   save and quit.
             - restart the ssh service.
                 - service ssh restart (restarting the ssh-service)
       d) trigger all above commands on all the servers.
       e)Now, we have to connect with Controller.
        here,we have trigger few commands:
         - sudo ssh-keygen
       f)here, we are connecting controller to servers.
         - sudo ssh-copy-id ubuntu@ipadreess of server1(private-ip)
         - sudo ssh-copy-id ubuntu@ipadreess of server2(private-ip)
         - sudo ssh-copy-id ubuntu@ipadreess of server3(private-ip)
       g) enter the password:
         like ****
         with above process our passwordless-ssh is done.
  
Now, here we need install ansible pre-required software-packages.
     1. Update the repository.
         sudo apt-get update
     2. install the software-properties-common package.
         sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common
     3. Again update the repository.
         sudo apt-get update
     4. Install the Ansible.
         sudo apt-get install -y ansible
     5. check the ansible version.
         ansible --version

Now, here we have to mention ip-address in inventory.
     In Controller,we have to fire all those commands:
      first, we have to mention Servers ip-address in inventory file.
       35.170.187.215
       172.31.88.135

for installing docker and nginx.we need to write a playbook.
 sudo vim playbook1.yml 
--- 
- name: install docker
  hosts: all
  tasks:
   - name: install python-pip
     apt:
      name: python-pip
      state: present
   - name: download & install docker and docker-py
     shell: "{{item}}"
     with_items:
       - curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
       - sh get-docker.sh
       - pip install docker-py
   - name: create nginx container
     docker_container:
      name:
      image: nginx
      ports:
        "9090:80"
...

  
to run the playbook:
ansible-playbook playbook1.yml -b

to check the nginx conatiner is installed or not.launch the browser
 take anyone managed server-ip address:9090
 like  35.170.187.215:9090
